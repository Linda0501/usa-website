  <p class="interviewer">JL: What year are you, what's your major, what semester is this for you in SAAS, and where are you from?
</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: I’m a freshman studying Statistics & Data Science. This is my second semester in SAAS and I’m from Rockville, MD.</p>

  <i style="font-size:18px;">Editor's Note: Rachel was in Web Dev at the time of this interview, and has since become a Web Dev Director for Fall 2019. </i>

  <p class="interviewer" style="margin-top:30px;">JL: What's Maryland like?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: Weather-wise, we have seasons! we get enough snow to close school and there’s a good amount of snow for sledding, but it’s not 2-3 feet tall like in new England. it can get pretty hot (90 degrees) in the summer. I live in Montgomery County which is right outside DC, so a lot of people’s parents work for NIH (National Institutes of Health), NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), or the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). So, a lot of people are interested in studying the natural sciences and going pre-med. Business and CS are definitely not as big as they are in the Bay Area. </p>

  <p class="interviewer">JL: Interesting. Well why did you decide on stats/data science then if everyone else was playing doctor?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: [Laughs] what’s interesting is that in high school I thought I was pre-law, I did mock trial and interned at a law firm. I wanted to do legal work for the Asian American community since I felt like the legal system was a crucial part of all of our lives, but many Asian immigrants have trouble navigating it due to language and cultural barriers. But in senior year my interests changed a lot. I started disliking reading (you have to do a LOT of reading as a lawyer) and also how you sometimes have to “lie” or at least leave out parts of the truth to paint a favorable story for your client. I always liked math in high school, so I came into college thinking I was going to major in Applied Math, but then I realized that I didn’t find abstract math the least bit interesting. So that brought me to stats/data science! I feel like data analysis can give you concrete answers to real-world problems using empirical information, which can have a big influence on decision making.</p>

  <p class="interviewer">JL: Was there a specific experience that pushed you to stats?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: I think it was just a combination of data 8 and CX; CX introduced me to some more advanced concepts in stats/data science and I heard a lot about upper div stats classes from upperclassmen and it seemed like something I would enjoy. It kinda opened a door to a whole new world for me as cliché as it sounds, so I really appreciate SAAS for doing that! My current opinion on CX is that although some of the concepts are definitely too advanced for the members to process, it’s a nice introduction to the things we will be learning as a stats major and can help you identify whether or not that’s the right path for you.</p>

  <p class="interviewer">JL: What other clubs are you in?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: I’m in yearbook.</p>

  <p class="interviewer">JL: What’s that?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: [Laughs again] everyone always says “I didn’t know we had a yearbook” whenever I tell ppl I’m in yearbook. We only put senior portraits; most of the book is about campus events, organizations, people, etc. We have 3 production teams: design, photo, and copy. We’re different from the daily Cal in that there’s more room for creativity; the writing (there’s a 300-word article for each event) is less of a purely informative purpose and more about using imagery and trying to capture the atmosphere of an event. Sample spreads here: <a href="https://yearbook.berkeley.edu/">https://yearbook.berkeley.edu/</a></p>

  <p class="interviewer">JL: Advertising are we? Any interesting/funny stories in the line of duty?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: Uh I went to a palatine’s event hosted by some cs/engineering organizations for valentine’s day, it was a meet-and-greet thing where they had icebreaker games, and I won a giant heart pillow from their raffle [Laughs again].</p>

  <p class="interviewer">JL: A lot of people aren't too sure what it is web dev does what do you personally do in web dev?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: I’m working on a front-end data visualization project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Leaflet (a JavaScript library) in a group of 3, we’re visualizing UCPD crime rates over January-March 2019.</p>

  <p class="interviewer">JL: What do you think your project will end up looking like?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: Oh, we’re making a heat map of the locations where crimes occur. We’re also trying to make it so that you can filter by type of crime.</p>

  <i style="font-size:18px;">Editor's note: The finished project is live and can be viewed <a href="{% url  'ucpd_crime' %}">Here!</a></i>

  <p class="interviewer" style="margin-top:30px;">JL: Whose idea was this?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: I don’t remember who specifically came up with it but it’s something that everyone in my group was really interested in doing, because safety/crime is an issue that affects all Berkeley students and we thought it would be important for people to know where the most crimes occur. </p>

  <p class="interviewer">JL: Web dev is famous for hosting Avalon games what has your experience been playing Avalon?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: I LOVE AVALON!!! This semester was my first time and it’s literally been the best thing SAAS has introduced me to. I used to be pretty bad at lying during games though but during Avalon everyone ALWAYS thinks I’m good when I’m actually bad, so I guess I’ve gotten a lot better at lying and being a snake lol. It’s also been a great bonding experience especially at retreat!!!!</p>

  <p class="interviewer">JL: Speaking about retreat, what has your experience been like in SAAS club wide, not just in your committee? I remember last semester you were infamous for going to every event and blowing everyone else out at the banquet when points were shown.</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: I like how there’s been a lot more events this semester. I feel like everyone in the club is super friendly and chill and also super smart and people give good advice regarding classes. [I don't know], I just wish more people came out to events and/or that we had more Avalon nights because all I really want to do is play Avalon. Having SAAS be so big is also hard since it’s harder to get to know people but I appreciate that there’s academic/professional support as well as social events! It’s like the best of both worlds.</p>

  <i style="font-size:18px;"> Editor's Note: the point system is how SAAS keeps track of who attends club events. Rachel was the #1 points holder in the semester that the points system was created, Fall 2018, and defended her title in Spring 2019, the semester in which this interview was conducted and published.</i>

  <p class="interviewer" style="margin-top:30px;">JL: Do you have anything else you want to say regarding anything to anyone who might be reading this?</p>
  <p class="interviewee">RL: Follow my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachellyeats/">food account</a>  and subscribe to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcfVklYryyi09J2B7Ei7rOA">YouTube channel</a>  :))) </p>
