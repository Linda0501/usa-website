    <h1> Data 8: Foundations of Data Science </h1>

    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p>
      The UC Berkeley Foundations of Data Science course (listed as COMPSCI/STAT/INFO C8 and commonly called “Data 8”) combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and design.
