		<h3> Testimonials </h3>
			<h4> How was your experience in this class?</h4>
      <i> "I found the class to be rather disorganized, but the material was very helpful. Upperclassmen may find the material less helpful since they might have seen it elsewhere already, but I took the class as a second semester freshman. Assignment instructions and grading schemes were not very clear, and the exam study guides were not indicative of the material/problems actually on the exam. Lectures were not the most engaging." </i>

      <h4> How many hours per week did you spend on the class (outside of lecture, discussion, etc.)? </h4>
      <i> "3" </i>
      <i> "2" </i>

      <h4> What is this class useful for? </h4>
      <i> "Learning R, git, regex, shell commands, data formats. Git and shell commands are things you don't really get to learn in depth in other classes but are super important in the real world."" </i>

      <h4> When should students take this course? </h4>
      <i> "freshman or sophomore year" </i>
      <i> "Any time only if you are a stats major" </i>

      <h4> What advice do you have for people taking this class in the future? </h4>
      <i> "Beware of T Y P O S on your test that you have to catch for points" </i>
      <i> "Read the textbook and really understand probability theory as a "math of random variable" in the same way as linear algebra as a "math of matrix/linear operator". </i>
