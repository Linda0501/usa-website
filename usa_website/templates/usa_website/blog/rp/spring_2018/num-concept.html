<div id=Introduction>
  <h2>Introduction </h2>
  <p>The question of how we come to develop the number concept over years of training in mathematics education has been hotly discussed and tested in various methods over the
  decades. The number concept refers to the ability of humans to associate quantities and
  magnitudes of concrete objects with abstract numbers, and the ability to perceive relationships
  and differences between numbers. Jean Piaget first popularized the idea of the “number
  concept” when he discovered that preschool children often fail to develop “one-to-one
  correspondence”; this is the ability to count and associate numbers with quantities of objects,
  recognizing that numbers are symbols to represent quantities. Over time, this number concept
  becomes increasingly advanced as one begins to recognize abstract relationships between
  numbers, such as addition, evenness and oddness, and factors and multiples.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">To try to assess what features of numbers people of different ages have understood and
  internalized, several psychological studies administered surveys that ask participants to rate the
  similarities between pairs of numbers. Based on these similarity ratings, the researchers used
  methods such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) (Shepard, Kilpatric, &amp; Cunningham, 1975;
  Miller &amp; Gelman, 1983) and Individual Differences Clustering (INDCLUS) (Miller &amp; Stigler, 1991)
  to find both visualizable and quantifiable methods of representing the implicit features and
  methods that these participants may have used in judging how similar certain numbers are to
  others.</p>
  <p>Our goal is to find out whether we can achieve consistent results from using both MDS
  and INDCLUS in analyzing individual survey results of number similarities. To do so, we
  gathered similarity ratings from a control group of participants, who did not undergo any
  interventions during the process of rating similarities between numbers. Proving there is a
  consistency between the results from both analysis methods will allow us to present more
  compelling evidence towards understanding the number concept of people of different ages.
  Going further, we plan to run experiments in which subjects judge the similarities between one
  group of numbers, undergo a certain educational intervention, and then judge the similarities
  between another group of numbers, to see if there was a difference in similarity judgments.
  Using the analysis methods of MDS and INDCLUS, we can then explore how certain
  educational interventions, such as math pedagogy or math-related activities, influence the
  number concept in humans.</p>
</div>

<div id=Methodology>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>The data were collected from an online Qualtrics survey <a href="https://ucbpsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0cc37YgiYXUpx3f"> (https://ucbpsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0cc37YgiYXUpx3f)</a> that was designed by Rachel Jansen of the Computational Cognitive Science Lab at UC Berkeley. The survey randomly
  chose 20 numbers from 2 to 30 that were divided into two groups of ten numbers each. (The
  division of numbers was designed so that each group has the same number of even/odd
  numbers, prime/composite numbers, etc. In future studies, one group would be used before
  intervention and the other after the intervention.) Subjects were asked to choose the most and
  least similar pairs of numbers among the 20 numbers, and then rated the similarities between all
  possible pairs of numbers within the set from a scale of 0 to 100, yielding 190 similarity ratings
  for each participant. (Some pairs contained two numbers from a single group, while others
  contained one number from each group of ten. While the similarity ratings for pairs of numbers
  within a single group were technically more useful for our assessment, we also included pairs of
  numbers between groups so that we could compare the clusters emerging from the set of all 20
  numbers with the clusters from each group of ten numbers.) Subjects then were asked a series
  of questions regarding features of numbers, such as “Which numbers are even?” or “Which
  numbers are multiples of 3?”, to assess whether they understood various numerical
  characteristics. Ultimately, however, only the similarity ratings are used in our analysis. A total of
  84 participants’ data were deemed eligible for analysis.</p>
  <p>We cleaned the data and converted it into a series of similarity matrices. These were
  generated from the average results of all 84 participants as well as each individual participant’s
  results. In addition, there were matrices for all 20 numbers and pairs of matrices, one for each
  group of 10 numbers. Using these matrices, we ran the MDS algorithm to generate 2D
  Cartesian Coordinate representations of the relationships between the numbers. (Generally in
  this spatial representation, the closer numbers are to each other, the more related they seem to
  be according to the participant’s judgment; the inverse is also true.) From the plots of all 84
  participants, we found certain plots that seemed to highlight significant characteristics and
  clustering between numbers, such as a clear divide between even and odd numbers or even a
  close cluster of prime numbers. Thus, we decided to use the INDCLUS model to find
  overlapping clusters of the numbers.</p>
  <p>Although we tried to use INDCLUS to run analyses based on these results, the
  documentation regarding the algorithm was sparse. The best code we could obtain for the
  algorithm was limited to an antiquated Fortran document, which we did not have the ability to
  operate. Therefore, we resorted to a similar algorithm called ADCLUS, or Additive Clustering, to
  analyze our results. ADCLUS is a slight simplification of INDCLUS, as it takes in only one
  similarity matrix and therefore does not account for all differences between individuals as
  INDCLUS does. In other words, it is a form of INDCLUS in which there is only one subject (n =
  1). To get around that issue, we ran a function named ADCLUS2 for the matrices of certain
  participants whose MDS plots seemed to have significant clusters (Used from Michael Lee’s
  website: <a href = 'http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/mdlee/similarity-data/'>http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/mdlee/similarity-data/)</a>. We did this to determine whether these clusters from the MDS plots were consistent with the clusters generated from the ADCLUS algorithm.</p>
  <p>The ADCLUS2 function is a modification of ADCLUS that uses additive clustering
  combined with stochastic hill-climb to get a better result than ADCLUS. It takes in an NxN
  symmetric matrix of pairwise similarities with a number of clusters, which specifies the number
  of clusters to use in the clustering process. After optimizing the clusters with respect to variance,
  ADCLUS2 eventually returns the best cluster membership matrix and its associated weights for
  each cluster. The weights represent how significant each cluster is compared to the others. For
  example, if the cluster with the highest weights happens to contain even numbers, then we can
  speculate that the participant emphasized even/oddness more than other numerical features
  when judging similarities between numbers.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>

  <div id=AvgResultsOf84Participants>
    <h3>1. Average Results of 84 Participants</h3>
    <p>We first ran MDS and ADCLUS2 on the average results of all 84 participants. We tested
    different numbers of clusters, and it seemed like 4 clusters gave the optimal clustering of
    numbers. From the results, it seems like both algorithms recognize that most of the clusters are
    based off of magnitude. There are clusters of “small” numbers (below 10), “medium” numbers
    (between 10 and 20), and “large” numbers (over 20), as well as a cluster of even numbers.</p>

<div id=DiscussionAndConclusion>
  <h2>Discussion and Conclusion</h2>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">From our results, we can generally conclude that there was some consistency between the MDS and ADCLUS analyses of similariy data. Clusters that were apparent visually in the MDS plots were generally detected by the ADCLUS algorithm and given significant weights. Clusters that were apparent when analyzing all 20 numbers together were generally also detected when analyzing the two groups of 10 numbers. However, there were exceptions, such as the results of the data from Participant #80, in which clusters that were significant when aggregating the 20 numbers were lost when splitting the numbers apart into two groups. Nevertheless, the analyses from the 20 numbers were just frames of reference. The main point of the study was to examine whether there was consistency between the analyses of the two groups of numbers, based on the data of our control group. (Without any educational or cognitive interventions, there should be no difference in how participants judge the similarities between numbers of each group, so the clusters of the two groups should arguably be similar.) Regarding that aspect, the results were fairly positive; generally, the clusters significant in Group 1 also showed up in Group 2, although there were still exceptions.
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">These issues of discrepancies between clustering analyses of different groups may have been alleviated if there were more numbers being compared in the study, but that would lead to an exorbitant number of comparisons between numbers that participants would have to make (with only 20 numbers, there were already 190 comparisons to be made). Nevertheless, the relatively small quantity of numbers we included in our study was a limitation to our analysis.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 20px">However, we do believe the overall results are positive enough for us to use both MDS and ADCLUS to assist our analyses of future studies. We plan to design studies in which a group of participants rates similarities between a group of 10 numbers, undergoes a certain intervention pertaining to mathematics (such as a lesson, a problem-solving task, or an activity), and rates a different set of 10 numbers (with roughly the same numerical features as those of the first group). Our analyses from the data of these future studies hopefully shed light on how certain interventions affect how one perceives relationships between numbers.</p>
