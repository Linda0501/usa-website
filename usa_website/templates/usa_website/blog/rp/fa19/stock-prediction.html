<div id="Section2">
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      In stock price prediction, there are 2 schools of thought: the Effecient Market Hypothesis(EMH) and Adapative Market Hypothesis (AMH). 
	  AMH states that stock prices are predictable and can be profited from. In this project, I want to explore the possibility of that.
    </p>
	
	<p>
      There are many factors that affect the price movements of stocks. However, it is a difficult feat to identify all of them. 
	  Moreover, it is impossible to encapsulate all these factors in a model as the problem size will be too huge for computation. 
	  Thus, in this project I will focus on a few technical indicators as features for my machine learning models.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="Section3">
  <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      The ultimate aim of this project is not to predict stock prices accurately as that is virtually impossible given my level of expertise. 
	  Rather, I will be comparing various methods and models to predict stock prices, and identify what makes them successful or unsuccessful. 
	  In my attempt to predict percentage change in stock prices, I will be looking at 2 broad categories of models: univariate and multivariate. 
	  The univariate model will serve as a benchmark for my project. Ultimately, I hope to be able to design a multivariate model that works better 
	  than the univariate model. In doing so, I will have successfully utilise the various technical indicators, and also develop a simple framework 
	  that can be used to predict changes in stock prices more accurately.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="Section4">
  <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      Due to the complexity and uncertainty of this problem, I have redesigned the methodology multiple times. After much contemplation, 
	  I have broken down my methodology into the following steps
    </p>
	
	<p>
    1. Feature Selection
		<ul>
			<li>Generate technical indicators that will be used as input variables for my model</li>
		</ul>
    </p>
    
	<p>
	2. Target selection
		<ul>
			<li>Due to the unpredictability of stock price movements, 
			it may or may not be easy to predict percentage changes in stock prices. 
			Feature-target correlation will have to be analysed to determine that.</li>
		</ul>
    </p>
	
	<p>
	3. Model Selection
		<ul>
			<li>Choosing which univariate model to use</li>
			<li>Choosing which multivariate models to use</li>
			
		</ul>
    </p>
	
	<p>
	4. Model assessment
		<ul>
			<li>Train the models and use them to predict results</li>
			<li>Compare results across all models (RMSE values)</li>
			
		</ul>
    </p>
	
	<p>
	5. Conclusion
		<ul>
			<li>Outcome and insights generated from this project</li>
			<li>Future work</li>
			
		</ul>
    </p>
</div>

<div id="Section5">
  <h3>Feature Selection</h3>
    <p>There are 4 major categories of technical indicators: Volatility, Trend, Momentum, Volume</p>
	
	<p>Due to time constraints, I was unable to select the best amongst the many different indicators 
	that are commonly used. However, I decided to use at least 1 indicator from each category for my model. 
	This is to ensure that my project covers the minimum breath or scope of technical indicators.</p>
	
	<p>Aside from these technical indicators, other possible features would include the percentage 
	change in price 1,2 and 3 days ago, as these intuitively seem to carry information of what 
	tomorrowâ€™s percentage change in price would be.</p>
	
	<p>Fundamental indicators was removed from the scope of the project. This is because it is 
	difficult to identify strong fundamental indicators, especially for short-term price predictions.</p>
</div>

<div id="Section6">
  <h3>Target Selection</h3>
    <p>After consulting seniors, setting percentage change in stock prices as a target variable/ dependent variable 
	seemed logical because afterall, traders are more interested in the percentage change in stock prices rather 
	than its absolute value when traders trade stocks.</p>
