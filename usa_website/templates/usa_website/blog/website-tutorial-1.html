  <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p>
      Hello and Welcome to Part 1 in our three part series on How To Build Your Own Personal Website! If you have not already,
      be sure to check out <a href= http://susa.berkeley.edu/blog/website-tutorial-0>Part 0: An Introduction To Git! </a>
      Technically, Part 0 is not required as we will only be dealing with local files in this and future installments of this tutorial
      series, but it doescontain important information about our overall goal with this series, collaborative work, and website hosting.
      Part 1 will be focused on explaining the basics of HTML, and Part 2 will show you how to combine HTML with CSS to give some style
      to your website. Part three will be focused on providing a very basic introduction to javascript.

  <h4>Introduction: What is HTML?</h4>
    <p>
      HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the core language behind building websites. We will be focusing on HTML5, the latest version of HTML.
      With HTML, you will have the basic building blocks to create headings, paragraphs, links, tables, images, and many more to use directly in your website.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you progress through the tutorial, be sure to open the page in your browser by right clicking the html file and selecting "Open with Firefox/Chrome"
      and see what the new bits of code do by refreshing your browser after every change! It will be helpful to see exactly how your web page changes as you add,
      modify, or delete elements.
    </p>

<div id="Step1">
  <h4>Step 1: Core HTML Elements</h4>
  <p>
    Let's set up our first HTML file! Open a text editor of your choice, and in your project folder, create a file called <code>index.html</code>.
    Your index will be the default or home page on your website. After this is done, enter in your first bit of HTML code:
    <pre>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
    The first line declares that your document should be read as an HTML file to your web browser. Following that are the opening and
    closing tags of <code>html</code>, which hold all elements for that webpage.
  </p>
  <p>
    For any element in HTML, you <b>must</b> have a pair of opening and closing tags of that element. This lets the browser know when to
    start and end a certain element. In the code you just entered, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> indicates the start of the <code>html</code>
    element, and <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> with the <code>/</code> indicates the corresponding closing tag to end the <code>html</code>
    element. If you forget to close your tags, the browser will automatically add them to render the page, but you may get strange-looking
    results! A good habit is to write both the opening and closing tags every time you add a new HTML element.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you try opening this page right away in your browser, you should see a blank, white page. Let's make it a little more interesting!
    Within the <code>html</code> tags, add the following:
    <pre>
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Enter title here&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
    </pre>
    You can think of the <code>head</code> element as a setup for your webpage: in here you can set the title of the page (via <code>title</code>
    tags) and "import" other files by linking to CSS or JavaScript files (more on this in the next tutorial). Refresh the page on your browser,
    and you should see the name in the tab holds what you entered within the <code>title</code> tags!
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's add some content to your web page. After the <code>head</code> element, add a <code>body</code> element, and within the
    <code>body</code> add a large heading (using an <code>h1</code> element) with your name and a short paragraph (using a <code>p</code>
    element) introducing yourself. Before you scroll down to see the code to do this, try implementing it yourself, then check back to
    see if you've done it correctly. Don't forget to close all your HTML tags!

    <pre>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;Your title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Anthony Yu&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm one of SUSA's Web Dev Directors!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>

    In HTML, there are six different headings, from <code>h1</code> (largest) to <code>h6</code> (smallest). <code>p</code> stands for
    "paragraph," good for entering regular text. Note that when you close your paragraph with <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>, you are adding a
    line break immediately after your text. The same holds true for headings.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      NOTE: HTML is white-space independent, so the line breaks and tabs you add will not show up when you open the
      page on your browser. Like any other programming or scripting language, be sure to indent your code to make it more readable to you
      and your collaborators!
